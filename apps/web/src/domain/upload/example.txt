Here is the best way to handle upload with Antd and the UploadApi: 

const [fileList, setFileList] = useState([])

const handleUpload = async options => {
  const { file } = options
  const url = await UploadApi.upload(file)
  setFileList(fileList => [...fileList, {url: url, status:'done'}])
}

<Upload fileList={fileList} customRequest={handleUpload}  maxCount={1}>
Upload
</Upload>
